## Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. For now, it's just a flake using home-manager for dotfiles management.

The goal is to have just one command which gets my latest dotfiles & software. The command should be **[idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)**

**To get started, simply open a terminal and run:**
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ardelean-Calin/dotfiles/main/dot.sh | bash  
```
